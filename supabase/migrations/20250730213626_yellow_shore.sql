  # Comprehensive RLS Policy Fix for Orders System

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Create new policies allowing anonymous order creation
    - Maintain security for viewing orders
    - Allow admin full access

  2. Policy Changes
    - Allow anonymous users to INSERT orders and related data
    - Allow customers to view their own orders via email
    - Allow admins to manage all orders
